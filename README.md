 ## Description

      I create a Pig-dice game as the forth Independent Project if you do not know how to play this game please read first instructions and enjoy with this game. 
      to get it on GTHUB : https://github.com/CarineIzere/PIG_DICE To see how it looks click here: 

## BDD
    The web application will request the names of two players:

    As a player, I want to roll the dice when it's my turn to play in the game.
    As a player, I want to see the score I get for each roll of the dice I make in the game.
    As a player, I want to see my cumulative score for each round I play in the game. For example, if I roll the scores 2-6-3 consecutively, I should see my end score as 11.
    As a player, I want the option to hold my score when I'm satisfied with the points I've gained in a round of playing. The game should, therefore, add my held score to my most recent cumulative score.
    As a player, I want to be alerted when my dice rolls on number 1. This will help me know that I can't roll the dice until the alternate player takes their round.
    a player, I need a way to know which player has won the game, which means they have scored 100 points before the alternate player.

    The first player to get 100 is the Winner!
